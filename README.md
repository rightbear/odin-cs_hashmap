# odin-cs_hashmap

This is the fourteenth project to work in the "JavaScript Course"

## The experience I get in this project

(2025/07/12) I complete this project with knowledges of JavaScript I learned in the previous course. I use Javascript concepts such as class, array, linked lists, hashMap and hashSet to build two classes and other methods to tackle with the map and set problem. With advices in Assignment of the project, I try seperating classes of HashMap and HashSet in `classes_hashMap.js` and `classes_hashSet.js` respectively. I also add basic methods for HashMap and HashSet such as set, get, has, remove, clear and so on. Futhermore, I use Node.js command environment to run and debug my classes in `main_hashMap.js` and `main_hashSet.js`. This activity strengthens my skills in Node.js and JavaScript.
